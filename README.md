# ShareMobilityApplication
This is a Test Environment for Initial App Development

Project Description:
We have been working on developing a smart phone app to provide on-demand flexible rides for commuters. Unlike traditional carpooling, commuter-based ridesharing provides flexibility in departure time. Compared to shared mobility services, such as Uber, our product is less expensive and more reliable as it guarantees a ride back. We have worked on the back-end of our product as well as the user interface.

Project Market:
Our product targets commuters. Individual commuters, employees, and cities may be interested in using our product to reduce congestion, alleviate problems with limited parking spaces, and reduce the cost of commuting. We have not validated our work to date.
